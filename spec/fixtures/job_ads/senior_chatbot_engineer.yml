job_description:
  "We’re on a mission to elevate team operations. We are building Pushbot, a platform for business processes. We believe that the time has come to set aside misfit, clunky, and legacy solutions. It’s time to embrace the modern era of cloud computing, conversational UI, bots, mobility, machine learning, and beautifully-designed, user-centric interfaces.

  Catalytic is looking for a senior-level engineer to lead development of our chat interface to Pushbot. You will own the conversation engine that will allow our customers to chat with Pushbot via email, Slack, HipChat, SMS, WeChat, etc. Your mission will be to ensure that users love interacting with Pushbot using natural, intuitive language. We have a working prototype in place for our pilot customers, so your focus will be on creating a solid foundation for us to build on.

  Our backend runs in node.js on AWS Lambda fronted by API Gateway and CloudFront. We’ve build an automated testing and deployment pipeline around GitHub, CircleCI and Slack. For storage we primarily use DynamoDB, S3 and ElasticSearch. Whether or not you’re already familiar with these or the dozen other services we use, together we’ll make sure you develop a deep expertise with all of them."
